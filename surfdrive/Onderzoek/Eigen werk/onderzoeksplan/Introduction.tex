\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Assessment is one of the most fundamental aspects of education, playing an integral role in teaching and learning. In particular, summative assessment is a key indicator for evaluating the extent to which learning objectives are being met. Adequately determining a student's proficiency of concepts, skills and competencies is a complex undertaking. Valid, objective, reliable, and fair assessments call for a setting in which students are given ample opportunity to provide evidence of their knowledge and skills in such a manner that a teacher can effectively observe and measure their level of mastery\todo{attainment level reached}. Computer science is a multifaceted subject, bringing together conceptual knowledge, computational thinking, and problem-solving skills. To assess achievement levels on its crossroads is far from trivial. In addition to pedagogical and content knowledge, it requires knowledge on constructing frameworks, test specifications, and the ability to align according to specific classroom needs. This research explores the characteristic features of effect assessment.

As of 2019, a reformed Computing Science curriculum will become effective in the Netherlands. The reformed program follows in the footsteps of recent international reforms (examples are the U.S. CSTA, U.K. National curriculum, New Zealand's new "Digital Technologies") where a shift from computer and ICT applications towards rigorous academic computing has taken place (e.g., Bell et al. 2010; Brown et al. 2013; Hubwieser 2012). The reform has resulted in a stronger focus on fundamental concepts, including analysis of standard algorithms and being able to compare efficiency and implementability. Higher-order (Computational Thinking) skills are positioned as a fundamental pillar, explicited as one of the 21st-century skills competencies (SLO2015-
\url{http://curriculumvandetoekomst.slo.nl/21e-eeuwse-vaardigheden/digitale-geletterdheid/}). The idea of Computational Thinking (CT) presents a different way of thinking about computing proficiency by emphasizing the (problem-solving) skills that students need to solve complex real-world problems and evaluate proposed solutions. It also signifies that solely measuring CS proficiency as the acquisition of core content knowledge is no longer sufficient. Despite the proliferation of CT-focused programs throughout several curricula around the world, there is still no general method on how to develop CT assessments reliably and easily (2017Catete). In their review study, Lye and Koh (2014) conclude that only very few studies have examined computational skills as outcomes and stunningly zero studies had been found with a focus on upper secondary high school. In the mean-time, Kings (2017) was able to locate one: Lee et. al. (2011). All-in-all, little research has been done on the effectiveness of the assessment materials available (Yadav, 2016).
How will this fundamental shift evolve (in) the Dutch educational landscape?




Currently, only a small percentage of the Dutch CS teachers has completed a full academic qualification to teach the subject (Tolboom et al., 2014). Speculating on their content knowledge (as a component of the PCK), Dutch teachers currently focus primarily on designing and implementing computer systems and programs (Schmidt, 2007) (Tolboom et al., 2014), rather the more fundamental underlying concepts which the new curriculum now focusses on. There is no central exam for the subject, no standardized assessments, and no way to ascertain the effectiveness of teaching. Teachers generally create their own assessments, generally by adapting others (Hermansen, 2014). There is usually only one teacher in a school, leaving them isolated from their peers. Compared to initiatives such as the U.K. Computing At School (CAS), professional development opportunities, communities of practice, sharing of experiences, resources, and lessons learned are sparse. All in all, teachers have no assessment benchmark, lack valid and reliable example assessments (2015 CSTA), and furthermore lack evaluation or reflection on their teaching strategies via peer-collaboration. In their research Grover and Pea (2013) describe attention to assessment as a pre-requisite to successful implementation of any curriculum and conclude that large gaps exist pertaining to assessment. Along the same line, Seiter (2013) describes assessment models incorporating progression pathways as vital for establishing research-based computational curricula.


There is a gap between the (meager) research and classroom practice (Yadav, 2015).  Computing education and research suffer from the lack of assessment instruments (Voogt et al., 2017). In their research [2010TewGuzdial], argument the importance of validated assessment that could be widely applicable across tertiary curricular approaches. This need may be even more true for secondary education, where far less relevant research has been done in the first place. Also, research developments are not accessible to teachers (either they need a paid subscription, academic literature may be written incomprehensibly, or not practical as it can't be implemented in the classroom in a cost-effective manner).

With all these factors in place, what is needed for teachers and their PCK to adapt to, and successfully implement, the curriculum reform?
