\section{Significance}\label{sec:significance}

The aim of work described in this thesis is to improve the assessment of algorithms and programming in secondary education by adding assessment elements design to overcome difficulties faced by teachers. We hope this paper will provide input for future development of assessment instruments and strategies and contributes to a national dialogue about how to support teachers to effectively assess their students learning.

\subsection{Study III. Bridging the gap of assessment knowledge.}
\subsubsection*{Practical significance}
Using the idea that assessments must be adapted and ‘recontextualized’ to fit classroom needs (Hermansen, 2014) as a starting point, the results of our research leads to a set of assessment templates, guidelines and examples which could help teachers understand the implications on the new curriculum, implement (aspects of) and adequately assess students’ knowledge in a cost-effective manner, yet fine-tuned to contexts relevant to their specific classroom setting. It enhances teachers’ PCK by supporting their ‘knowledge work’ (i.e. the activities which they carry out based on the knowledge from their professional practice).%, lowers workload and increases self-efficacy.

In addition, our research informs educational researchers and professional development programs about what types of assessments and instruments are suitable for testing algorithmic and computational thinking concepts and what knowledge and skills teachers need to be adept with in order to apply these assessments.

\subsubsection*{Scientific significance}


The aim of work described in this thesis is to improve the assessment of algorithms and programming in secondary education by:
\begin{itemize}
\item establishing a progression pathway wish integrates conceptual knowledge as well as computational practices,
\item adding assessment elements to specifically pinpoint achievement levels of conceptual knowledge and computational practices independently, and
\item analyzing and determining the teachers' PCK needed to deliver and implement such an assessment.
\end{itemize}


Assessment researchers need to better understand the design principles and psychometric properties of assessments that integrate computational thinking and problem solving with the fundamental concepts of computing science. CS education researchers wish to better understand the implications of widespread adoption of the CT learning perspective, including the implementation of reformed CS curricula and teacher professional development. Computer Science educators and policy makers want assessments that reliably measure the knowledge and abilities that are needed to engage in and support computer science learning in the classroom.




\subsection{Study IV. Variable features: untangling programming tasks.}
\todo{see de raadt 2008 dissertation for his significance.. where he says teach, you say assess}
\subsubsection*{Practical significance}

The results of our research leads to a set of template assessment tasks which could be used by teachers (of both secondary and tertiary CS education). The tasks help teachers identify which specific concept or strategy is problematic for a student. This basis can be used for determining variable features in programming tasks, and thus facilitating differentiation in the classroom. Tailored assessment could lead to shorter and faster tests (Zavala, 2018). Students not capable of completing a complex task could be given more fundamental tasks, while competent students could be given more challenging tasks. For example, a student not capable of understanding a selection in a loop could be then be given subsequent tasks on 1) selections, 2) loops, and 3) nesting to pinpoint what is specifically causing the struggle. The test can stop as soon as an adequate assessment of the student’s knowledge has been made. In addition, this effort contributes as input for 'task variables' of the design template (part of the ECD Conceptual Assessment Framework level), and the hierarchy can be used to vary the difficulty of tasks set.




Traditionally, a teacher may attempt to establish a multiple-choice question with distracters to pinpoint the misconception, this has a few drawbacks. Firstly, it is very difficult to establish meaningful distracters, contrarily, students are sometimes even be provoked or put on the wrong track by distracters. Furthermore, if a student is struggling with two of these concepts, only one will be brought to light. In order to determine what the particular misconception is that the student is struggling with, required answering many more tasks. As assessments are created a priori, the tasks are not relevant to, or correspond with, the students level of understanding. Pre-defined tasks may be more complex, such as the previous question extended into a multi-branch selection. With the knowledge that the student could not answer the previous question, such an extended question is not reasonable to ask. It does not elicit any extra knowledge about the students level of attainment, and thus only bourdons the student's time and possibly lowering their self-efficacy. In turn, this last aspect is not constructive for the motivation (one of the characteristics which good assessments should adhere to, see section \ref{sec:qualityCriteria}). Contrarily, if a student fails to complete this task correctly, they should be given 3 subtasks, one for each of the concepts which it entails. Obviously, the student must complete 3 extra questions. But it does allow for a more precise assessment, pointing out exactly which concept the student is struggling with and what the student is proficient in. Such feedback could well be used for both formative (feedback on what to work on) and summative assessment.




%Subsequently, a pilot was initiated to research the design template from the Assessment Implementation and Assessment Delivery layers. During the implementation stage, the model assessment tasks were translated into classroom-specific assessment tasks in the designated programming language. The task variables can be integrated to vary the difficulty of a task.




As most research has been done in tertiary education (CS1 and CS2 courses) where assessments focus on a more advanced level of understanding and coincide with both higher developmental stage and cognitive load than is expected from students in secondary education, teachers could benefit from research focusing specifically on more fundamental and isolated assessment tasks.


\todo{This study is a part of a larger study in which a template for assessment tasks for secondary education are established to cater teachers on their mission to create qualitative assessment tasks adapted to their own specific classroom needs.}


\subsubsection*{Scientific significance}
The results of our research could lead to a set of assessment tasks which could be used by researchers to better investigate the understanding and alternative conceptions of students at both secondary and tertiary CS educational institutes. In particular, it is a novel step towards research specifically focused at secondary education and could highlight the specific differences between students at secondary and tertiary education.

The results of this study could be used as input for the conceptual assessment framework as a basis for determining variable features in programming tasks. This may contribute to the field of automated and/or adaptive testing (Zavala, 2018) and intelligent tutoring systems (Luxton-Reilly et al., 2018).


Future studies may include transforming the task into tasks easier to grade and analyze (such as multiple-choice assessment tasks, possibly combined with short-answer questions), tasks developed to specifically seek out common misconceptions, tasks for ‘creating’, and relating the assessment tasks to a CS-adequate taxonomy.
