\section{Aim of the thesis}\label{sec:aim}
All-in-all, little research has been done on the effectiveness of the assessment materials available \cite{Yadav2016}. Recent published work based on CT focusses on primary education or middle school \cite{LyeKoh2014}. Research based on (the assessment of) CS concepts has a focus on tertiary education (such as \cite{McCracken2001},\cite{2010TewGuzdial}). More specifically, we know little about how teachers are to assess specific CS concepts or computational practices pertaining to Algorithms and Physical Computing in secondary education.

The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the knowledge about assessment pertaining to the domains of algorithms, physical computing and their related computational practices and typifying which PCK it demands from teachers to assess these domains.

\noindent \textbf{Task difficulty}\newline
Section \ref{sec:researchAssProgramming} describes that despite efforts from the research community, creating programming assessment tasks that measure what we wish to measure, especially with respect to difficulty, remains a challenge. It was outlined that several researches attempt to classify tasks according to task-oriented features, however do so without isolating the elementary concepts from the strategies, and as a result try to assess (nested) concepts and (problem-solving) strategies simultaneously. Determining task difficulty could be facilitated by clearly separating conceptual knowledge from computational practices (as proposed by \citeauthor{BrennanResnick2012}). As proposed by \citeauthor{deRaadt2009teachingPlans}, plans could be integrated into tasks order to assess strategies. To our knowledge, there has not yet been an attempt to systematically untangle assessment tasks by focussing on computational practices and in doing so, isolating and identifying not only elementary programming concepts but also algorithmic components \cite{deRaadt2008}. The focus lies specifically on the fundamental CS concept of algorithms and the closely coupled algorithmic thinking (as a part of CT) and problem solving skills. The choice for a focus on algorithms is not an arbitrary one. With the curriculum reform, this fundamental concept has become much more theoretical. In addition, algorithmic development and Computational Thinking skills go hand-in-hand and few teachers of aware of the recent research in this area, let alone have any idea on how to assess this.

This leads us to our first question about how variable features of \emph{task difficulty}, specifically related to computational practices, can be identified, accounted for and integrated into an assessment.


\noindent \textbf{Task contexts}\newline
%    \item 1b. Algorithms: How can the variable features of task contexts be identified, accounted for and integrated into an assessment?
Problem solving involves a continuous process of abstracting and choosing new contextualizations within new situations \cite{oers2004recontextualization}. That transfer and the process of abstraction (as an aspect of CT) is perceived as an important higher-order skill has been discussed in section \ref{sec:AlgProblemSolving}. In addition to dealing with diversity and enhancing inclusion, providing students with meaningful tasks tailored to their specific needs constitutes one of the quality criteria for assessments \ref{fig:AssQualityCriteria}. Despite attempts by researchers in different domains, they have not yet been able to pinpoint the mechanisms behind transfer \cite{oers2004recontextualization}. Though the mechanisms may not yet be crystal clear, understanding which types of contexts can be related and how abstraction can be used to enhance transfer could lead to more attractive and relevant tasks for the students, in addition to a larger and more flexible pool of assessment questions for the teachers to draw upon.

This leads us to the second question about how variable features of \emph{task contexts} be identified, accounted for and integrated into an assessment.



\noindent \textbf{Design skills}\newline
%    \item 1c. Algorithms: How can attainment levels of design skills be identified, elicited, and measured?
%    \item 2a. Physical Computing: How can attainment levels of design skills be identified and measured?
Globally, reformed computer science curricula have made an educational shift in focus from 'user' to 'creator'. With it, this movement has placed emphasis on the higher-order Computational Thinking skills involved with solving complex problems \cite{Wing2006}. Thus, skills used during the design and development of a digital artifacts have become predominant. These skills include evaluation of quality, such as correctness and efficiency, and weighing options by means of research and experimentation. Current research is focussed merely on concepts. \citeA{LyeKoh2014} express that only assessing concepts is not enough and additionally embrace computational practices as distinguished by \citeauthor{BrennanResnick2012}. Understanding how to deliberately put students into situations (with challenges or tasks) which elicit these skills is imperative to adequately measure attainment levels. In their review study \citeA{voogt2017effecten} discuss how computing education research in primary and secondary education struggles with a lack of reliable, validated, and theoretically grounded CT assessment instruments. We focus specifically on the design of software and Physical Computing.

This leads us to the third question about how attainment levels of design skills can adequately be identified, elicited, and measured.




\noindent \textbf{Physical Computing}\newline
%    \item 2b. Physical Computing: How can knowledge of concepts of Physical Computing (embedded systems) be identified and measured?
Physical Computing is a newly emerging field in computer science education.

This leads us to the fourth question, about how the knowledge of concepts of Physical Computing (embedded systems) can be identified and measured.



\noindent \textbf{Assessment PCK}\newline
%    \item 3. PCK:  What characterizes the PCK of Physical Computing, Algorithms and computational practices, specifically the PCK component pertaining to effective assessment?
Teachers find it difficult to assess student learning in computer science \cite{yadav2016pck}. There is a gap between the (lean) research and classroom practice \cite{Yadav2015}. In their research \citeA{2010TewGuzdial}, argument the importance of validated assessment that could be widely applicable across tertiary curricular approaches. This is even more so for secondary education, where far less relevant research has been done in the first place.



  %In addition, research developments are not accessible to teachers. They need a paid subscription, and academic literature may be written in an incomprehensible manner, or not practical as it can't be implemented in the classroom in a cost-effective manner (for example think-aloud sessions).

Teachers will and should create assessments tailored specifically to their classroom needs, but lack specific PCK to do so. As the more conceptual topics and their corresponding student skills are new, teachers may be concerned about not matching the expectations of the curriculum's standards. The introduction of the new computing curriculum could benefit from understanding how to support teachers whilst creating qualitative knowledge and competency based assessments. Not only is creating a qualitative assessment acknowledged as a difficult task, in the current situation, teachers must first acquire and internalize knowledge about the new concepts. It would be interesting to understand what characterizes and typfies PCK for effective assessment. This could provide insight on knowledge patters and (evaluation) strategies with regards to assessment. This insight is three-fold:
\begin{itemize}
\item inform required professional development,
\item typify knowledge to analyse and prescribe assessment design practices of teachers, and
\item establish good practices and evidence of assessment principles.
\end{itemize}

This leads us to the fifth question, namely what characterizes the PCK of Physical Computing, Algorithms and computational practices, specifically the PCK component pertaining to effective assessment.
